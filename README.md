# PerceptronsBranchesPredictors
 This repository hosts code for a predictor of branches predictors using perceptrons as the main approach.

Artificial intelligence is an area that has been widely used in several sectors,  due to its competence in creating mathematical models and estimat-ing results.  Branch prediction is one of the most important topics in computerdesign.  It is largely responsible for determining whether a pipeline executionflows is correct on processors when they are executing conditional branch in-structions,  in  order  to  avoid  undesirably  losing  clock  cycles.   Nowadays,  wehave  some  literature  that  shows  the  use  of  some  methods  to  implement  dy-namic branch predictors with artificial intelligence,  but many of these workstry to increase the reduction o Miss Prediction, however, they use methodolo-gies that implement non-causal systems and that do not allow concrete imple-mentation in computational systems, despite having a high success rate.  Thiswork aims to carry out a study of parameters and implementation of branchpredictors  using  artificial  intelligence  with  traces  generated  by  a  MIPS  sim-ulator  designed  with  ArchC.  We  compared  the  results  of  our  work  with  the[Defalque and Thames 2017] approach and had, for some Bechmark programsused, a hit rate greater than 99%.
